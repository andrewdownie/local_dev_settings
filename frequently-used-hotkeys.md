## Using VIM in VSCode
Using the vim extension in vscode creates a strange hybrid where half the hotkeys are from vscode, and half the hotkeys are from vim.

## VSCode Activity bar
- Explorer: ctrl + shift + e
- Search: ctrl + shift + f
- Git: ctrl + shift + g
- Debug: ctrl + shift + d
- Extensions: ctrl + shift + x
- Hide activity bar: focus on the Activity bar (with any of the above commands) and then crtl + b  
- collapse all items in the current list: ctrl + leftArrow
- Create and name new file: ctrl + n (this requires rebinding ctrl + n to 'File: New File', instead of 'File: New Untitled File')

## VSCode Editor
- open and close terminal: ctrl + `
- code panel 1: ctrl + 1
- code panel 2: ctrl + 2
- code tab 1: alt + 1
- code tab 2: alt + 2
- format current document: shift + alt + f

## Bash
- ctrl + u to delete current line
- ctrl + l to clear visible terminal area

## Chrome
- ctrl + tab to shift one tab to the right
- ctrl + shift + tab to shift one tab to left
- ctrl + t to create a new tab
- ctrl + w to close current tab
- ctrl + num to jump to tab at index (how do you jump past tab 10 tho?)
- ctrl + l to jump to address bar

## cVim for Chrome
- gi to jump to first input
  - tab to jump to next input
- is there anyway to jump to first button, and then tab between buttons?

## Windows
- winKey + num to jump to corresponding app on the taskbar

## Autohotkey
Rebind Left-Windows Key up event to shift one desktop to the left
Rebind Right-Windows Key up event to shift one desktop to the right
See Autohotkey file in this repo

## Postman
- Ctrl + enter to send current request
