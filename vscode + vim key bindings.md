# VSCode + Vim keybinds quick reference
Using the vim extension in vscode creates a strange hybrid where half the hotkeys are from vscode, and half the hotkeys are from vim.

## Activity bar:
- Explorer: crtl + shift + e
- Search: crtl + shift + f
- Git: crtl + shift + g
- Debug: crtl + shift + d
- Hide activity bar: focus on the Activity bar (with any of the above commands) and then crtl + b

- open and close terminal: crtl + `
- code panel 1: crtl + 1
- code panel 2: crtl + 2
